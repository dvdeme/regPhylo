Description: The regPhylo package provides functions to assist in building 
    phylogenetic trees appropriate for use in ecological studies, particularly
    for a regional species pool. The regPhylo functions may be used in series 
    (following the short tutorial "Appendix 1" explaining the workflow and features, 
    or case-study tutorial “Appendix 2” reproducing the methods used in the case 
    study of Eme et al. (2019), starting with a list of focal taxa, to create a
    file ready to run using the software BEAST2, 
    (appropriate for estimating time-calibrated trees and including phylogenetic 
    uncertainty in downstream ecological analyses). Alternatively, individual functions 
    may be used to perform a number of data acquisition (DNA sequences and metadata),
     manipulation, and quality checks helpful for any phylogenetic analysis.
    Provided functions help to geo-locate DNA sequences, 
    select appropriate gene regions, concatenate multiple alignments, build topologically 
    constrained guiding trees, and edit xml files used by the BEAST2 software (to include topological 
    constraints and calibration points following the CladeAge approach).
    In addition, regPhylo assists users in accessing several standalone softwares 
    from within the R environment to perform multiple alignments, compare alignments
    to remove poorly aligned positions within alignments, 
    and to prepare input files for phylogenetic analyses.
    The philosophy of the package is described in Eme et al. (2019) Global Ecology and Biogeography.
