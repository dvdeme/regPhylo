# regPhylo

Our R package regPhylo provides a pipeline to construct a Bayesian posterior distribution of time‐calibrated trees suitable to address ecological questions. The novel contributions of regPhylo include options to: use prior phylogenetic knowledge through flexible topological constraints; include spatial metadata in sourcing DNA sequences; and include taxa without DNA sequences and then infer consequent phylogenetic uncertainty. Specifically, regPhylo helps researchers: retrieve DNA sequences; enhance available metadata; select DNA sequences based on their length or spatial proximity to the region of study; align sequences; and perform quality control. Output from the pipeline is a file ready to run in the Bayesian tree reconstruction software beast2, appropriate for estimating time‐calibrated trees and including phylogenetic uncertainty for downstream analyses.
